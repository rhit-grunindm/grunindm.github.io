        <p>Working with computers and software has always been an aspiration of mine. Ever since I was a little kid, I have always loved computers and have been fascinated at what they can do. Now I am a senior Computer Science and Software Engineering double major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I have internship and classroom experience in building websites, sorting & optimizing speed with data structures, pulling data from databases, designing software systems, programming robots, working on security infrastructure, and building and refactoring large software projects.</p>
        <p>My experience with materials I learned in class, skills I have attained on my own, and internship projects have provided me with a robust understanding of the programming languages and problem solving abilities required for a full time developer opportunity. These skills and problem solving techniques helped me at great lengths during my first internship three summers ago as a software developer. I spent a large part of this internship working on the back end of a company website in PHP, a programming language that I had never touched before. Although intimidating at first, I was able to refactor and update the entire company website, consisting of ~10,000 lines of PHP and JavaScript code, all during the last month of my internship. Additionally, two summers ago, I worked on an Oracle database for an industrial coating company; using extensive SQL queries to pull in specific data from the database into excel sheets. Once in the excel sheet, I would then work on macros and formulas to create views for which production managers could look at where specific parts were in the production process. Last summer, I worked at a power company to help install and analyze a SIEM for log collection and analysis via SSH. This internship was particularly unique since much of it was done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>Aside from lots of software experience, I have also worked in other regions of computing. I have built a 16-bit processor from scratch and spent part of my internship assembling and fixing low-level computer hardware. Additionally, I worked in a Linux OS in my first internship while doing the previously mentioned website migration. My skills with data structures has also been a strong point for me, as one of my in class projects was to build an editor tree to search, remove, and add characters in log(n) speed. I ended up liking that class so much that I now TA for it! Outside of school, I was the academic chair for my fraternity where I helped struggling brothers do better in classes. I also like to play games and am an outgoing people person who likes conversing with friends, family, and coworkers.</p>
